# Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch

Neural networks (NN) can be introduced to bias via the environment and data on which the network was trained or the network constraints (like parameters). White noise analysis (i.e. the subject of this paper) protocols investigate the inherent biases within a single neuron and network levels.
Based on the paper "WHITE NOISE ANALYSIS OF NEURAL NETWORKS" by Ali Borji and Sikun LIN, now I am training two simple NNs on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, calculating average noise maps for each class in the datasets, determining what the model classifies each noise map, and using the noise maps themselves as the classifier. I will continue posting about this work.
